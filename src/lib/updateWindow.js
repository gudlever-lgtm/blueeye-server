// A maintenance window for self-updates, as 'HH:MM-HH:MM' in the AGENT's local
// time. Empty means any time.
//
// The agent is what evaluates it, because only the agent knows its own local
// time — a fleet spread over three time zones cannot have "02:00" decided
// centrally. The server validates the string and passes it down; this module is
// byte-identical in blueeye-agent (src/updateWindow.js) so both sides agree on
// what a window means, including the part below that is easy to get wrong.
//
// A window may WRAP midnight: '22:00-04:00' is the four hours after ten at
// night plus the four before four in the morning, not an empty range. The
// nightly window people actually want is the wrapping one, so treating it as
// empty would silently mean "never update".
//
// Both ends are inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end, so two adjacent
// windows never both match the same minute.

// Returns { startMin, endMin } in minutes past local midnight, or null when the
// string is absent or not a window. A window of zero length ('02:00-02:00') is
// not a window: it would match nothing, and reading it as "always" is the kind
// of guess that pushes code at lunchtime.
