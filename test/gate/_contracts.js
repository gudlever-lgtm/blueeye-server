// CROSS-REPO CONTRACTS — the shared definitions blueeye-server, blueeye-agent
// and blueeye-licens each keep their OWN copy of.
//
// Four things are duplicated across the three repos today, each carrying a
// comment that says some version of "MUST stay identical, keep in sync":
//
//   canonicalize()      the exact bytes a licence proof / release manifest /
//                       privileged command is signed over. licens signs them,
//                       server and agent reproduce them to verify.
//   PROTOCOL_VERSION    the agent↔server wire-contract version.
//   the evidence        what an evidence snapshot may ask an agent to collect.
//   allowlist           The agent enforces its own copy as defense in depth.
//   verifyProof/        same Ed25519 check, same "any error is not verified"
//   verifyPayload       semantics, on both ends of the licence.
//
// A comment is not an enforcement mechanism. Nothing stopped a well-meaning
// edit to one copy, and the failure modes are quiet and severe: a canonicalize
// that diverges by one byte makes EVERY licence proof fail to verify on every
// customer install, and an allowlist that diverges is a security control that no
// longer matches its counterpart.
//
// So this module pins them, and each repo's gate asserts its own copies against
// the same pins. Two layers, because they catch different things:
//
//   BEHAVIOUR — fixed vectors through canonicalize(). This is what actually
//     breaks signatures, and it is checked without needing the sibling repos on
//     disk. A refactor that keeps the output identical passes, correctly.
//
//   SOURCE DIGEST — the implementation with comments and whitespace removed.
//     The three copies differ only in their header comments, so normalising
//     those away gives ONE digest for all three. This catches an edit that
//     happens to keep the vectors passing but changes the code anyway, and it
//     makes the sync deliberate: change the function and this repo's gate fails
//     until you update the pin — at which point the OTHER two repos' gates fail
//     until they are updated too. That is exactly the handshake the comments
//     were asking for.
//
// Changing a pin is a cross-repo change. Do all three, in one go.
