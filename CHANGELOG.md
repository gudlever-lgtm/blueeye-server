## 0.79.0 — Cross-agent incident clusters: operator API + lifecycle

Builds the operator-facing surface on top of the existing cross-agent clustering
engine (detector + dedup/auto-resolve + AI advisory + alerting already shipped in
0.7x). No parallel correlation system — this reuses the engine as-is.

### Added
- **REST API** `/api/incident-clusters` (`src/routes/incidentClusters.js`):
  - `GET /` — list with `status` + `from`/`to` filters and `limit`/`offset`
    pagination (viewer+).
  - `GET /:id` — full cluster: hydrated member findings + evidence, affected
    agents/targets, a weighted **confidence breakdown** (signals + score vs the
    single-signal baseline), a suspected **root-cause layer**
    (network-/application-layer/undetermined, reusing the L2
    `isAppMetric`/`isNetMetric` classifiers) and a plain-language evidence
    summary (viewer+).
  - `POST /:id/ack` — acknowledge (operator+, hash-chained audit).
  - `POST /:id/resolve` — resolve with a **required free-text note** (operator+,
    audited).
- Pure read-model assembly `src/analysis/clusterView.js` and a
  `confidenceBreakdown` helper on `crossAgentCorrelator`.
- Migration **060** — `incident_clusters` gains the `acknowledged` status plus
  `acknowledged_at`/`acknowledged_by`, `resolved_by`, `resolution_note`.

### Changed
- Auto-resolve now **never closes a cluster that still holds an unacknowledged
  CRIT member finding** (existing retention rule), and the default quiet period is
  **30 min** (was 15). `open` and `acknowledged` both count as live for
  dedup/auto-resolve.
- `incidentClustersRepository` gains `acknowledge`/`resolve`/`count` and
  time-range + pagination on `list`.

### Tests
- API tests (happy path, 400/401/403/404/409, clean 500), pure unit tests for the
  confidence breakdown + root-cause classification + detail assembly, and a
  simulation test (10 agents, one shared finding-type within 3 min → exactly one
  cluster with all 10 members, confidence above the single-signal baseline).
